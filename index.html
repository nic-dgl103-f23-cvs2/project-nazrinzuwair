                        The BC Day weekend was lovely. Kim and her family went camping, so I got to experience the Filberg Festival with my Mom and 3 kids. WOW! It's been about 8 years since my last visit and what a lovely event. I have to say that I was amazed at the level of organization and service. Our best experience was with the friendly (Ambassador) shuttle drivers who assured me that my crew and huge double stroller could get there simply. They were right! We were very impressed - thank you!

                        A quick shout out to Courtena's newly-minted taxi service - Ambassador Transportation Corporation and Kevin East! I am an entrepreneur who owns property in Gastown where I work during the week, and retreat to my recreational home at Mt Washington for seasonal hiking and skiing. Today, I was in a bind to get to a Harbour Air Flight in Comox on Monday, and googled taxi operators in the Comox Valley.  The first searches which surfaced were Comox Taxi, which looked like the only game in town for taxi service.  A few minutes ago, I called Comox Taxi and warmly inquired about service to Mt. Washington, and acknowledged up front that I would expect a fair surcharge to drive up the mountain to pick me up for my fare to Comox's Harbour Air. But $120.00?!  I just about fell off my chair.  Not only was the fare outrageous, the terse and less than amiable (if not arrogant) dispatcher surely lost my business.  Luckily, (and buried within the google search) was Kevin's new service that recently launched.   Not only was he gracious and amiable, his rates to come up the hill were 60% less than Comox Taxi.Check out Kevin's Ambassador Transportation at 1.877.339.5252. I will be passing the word along to use Kevin's transportation service to my many friends and business associates when they come into the pristine Comox Valley for business and recreation!
